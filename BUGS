Known Issues in Asterisk 1.0
============================
In order to provide a path for a stable Asterisk 1.0, the Asterisk CVS tree
was forked into a a 1.0-stable branch.  Many new features and enhancements
have been added to the development tree in the mean time since the branch,
but in the interest of stability, only bug fixes were accepted into the 
stable branch, meaning that over time, there has been a substantial
diversion of the feature set between stable (1.0) and developmental
Asterisk.  This section is a list of important differences between the
stable (1.0) and development versions of Asterisk.

* The number of SIP channels that can be simultaneously run through Asterisk
  may be more limited than in development releases.

* When Asterisk carries media from one RTP or IAX connection to another, 
  jitter on one side can sometimes be reflected in the timestamps going
  to the other, causing the audio to be broken up on poor quality network
  connections.  This behavior has been changed in development releases.

* The MGCP channel driver has been greatly extended in development releases.

* The VPB (Voicetronix) driver in 1.0 only works with properly with FXO 
  interfaces.  Extensive work has been done on the driver in the development
  channel.

* The SIP channel driver's ability to negotiate codecs has been improved
  in developmental Asterisk.

* The return result of app_system is unrealiable in 1.0 and has gone through
  extensive rework in developmental Asterisk.

* The queue system has been extensively reworked with a variety of new
  features in developmental Asterisk.
